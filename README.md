# Line-following-with-Python-OpenCV
This project is based on IoT which uses open libraries like Numpy and OpenCV with Python 2.7.
The project has the following guidelines:
The robot has to follow the black line on the arena and there are some black rectangular zones where there are a few color markers which can be of 3 colors: RED, BLUE or GREEN and of 3 shapes : CIRCLE,SQUARE,TRIANGLE. At each such black rectangular zone, the robot has to stop and identify the shape, color and count of these color markers according to which a speicfic image of a plant has to be overlayed on a background image using Python only. There is a RGB LED which has to light in the same color as the color marker and as many times as the count of the color marker.
